This dataset is designed to simulate real-world trading scenarios, allowing models to perform agent-based financial trading. The task evaluates the models on multiple financial metrics such as Cumulative Return (CR), Sharpe Ratio (SR), Daily Volatility (DV), Annualized Volatility (AV), and Maximum Drawdown (MD). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's profitability, risk management, and decision-making capabilities.
To ensure a fair and unbiased assessment of the models' true capabilities, all evaluations are conducted in zero-shot settings (0-shots). This approach eliminates any potential advantage from task-specific fine-tuning, providing a clear indication of how well the models can generalize to new tasks.
