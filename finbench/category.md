# Categories
The selection of task categories in OFLL is intentionally designed to capture the full range of capabilities required by financial models. This approach is influenced by both the diverse nature of financial applications and the complexity of the tasks involved in financial language processing.

  - Information Extraction (IE): The financial sector often requires structured insights from unstructured documents such as regulatory filings, contracts, and earnings reports. Information extraction tasks include Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction, and Causal Classification. These tasks evaluate a model’s ability to identify key financial entities, relationships, and events, which are crucial for downstream applications such as fraud detection or investment strategy.
  - Textual Analysis (TA): Financial markets are driven by sentiment, opinions, and the interpretation of financial news and reports. Textual analysis tasks such as Sentiment Analysis, News Classification, and Hawkish-Dovish Classification help assess how well a model can interpret market sentiment and textual data, aiding in tasks like investor sentiment analysis and policy interpretation.
  - Question Answering (QA): This category addresses the ability of models to interpret complex financial queries, particularly those that involve numerical reasoning or domain-specific knowledge. The QA tasks, such as those derived from datasets like FinQA and TATQA, evaluate a model’s capability to respond to detailed financial questions, which is critical in areas like risk analysis or financial advisory services.
  - Text Generation (TG): Summarization of complex financial reports and documents is essential for decision-making. Tasks like ECTSum and EDTSum test models on their ability to generate concise and coherent summaries from lengthy financial texts, which is valuable in generating reports or analyst briefings.
  - Forecasting (FO): One of the most critical applications in finance is the ability to forecast market movements. Tasks under this category evaluate a model’s ability to predict stock price movements or market trends based on historical data, news, and sentiment. These tasks are central to tasks like portfolio management and trading strategies.
  - Risk Management (RM): This category focuses on tasks that evaluate a model’s ability to predict and assess financial risks, such as Credit Scoring, Fraud Detection, and Financial Distress Identification. These tasks are fundamental for credit evaluation, risk management, and compliance purposes.
  - Decision-Making (DM): In finance, making informed decisions based on multiple inputs (e.g., market data, sentiment, and historical trends) is crucial. Decision-making tasks simulate complex financial decisions, such as Mergers & Acquisitions and Stock Trading, testing the model’s ability to handle multimodal inputs and offer actionable insights.
